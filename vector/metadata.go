// The Value tagged union, its ValueKind enumeration, the Metadata map, the
// Value constructors, and the ValueKind text (un)marshaling now live in the
// engine-free vtypes leaf package and are re-exported via vtypes_aliases.go.
// The two helpers below stay here because they are used only by the filter
// compiler in this package, not by the wire codec or client.

// recordResolver is the package-level record.Resolver shared by every filter
// evaluation and (from Task 6) indexing pass. 1024 rather than a smaller
// number: on clear-when-full the cache falls back to a full schema decode,
// and a single collection can carry many schema versions over its lifetime
// (every operate schema change adds one), so a small bound would thrash.
// Resolver is safe for concurrent use (its own doc comment), so one instance
// is shared across every query goroutine.

// lookupPath resolves a (possibly dotted, possibly record-path) field name
// against metadata. It always tries the EXACT key first, so a flattened
// dotted key (e.g. the flat entry {"address.city": ...}) matches and
// non-dotted keys behave exactly as a raw map lookup — fully
// backward-compatible. A payload key literally named "a/b" therefore always
// wins over treating "a/b" as "payload key a, record path b".
//
// Only when there is no exact match does it try record.SplitField: if field
// splits into payloadKey/path and m[payloadKey] holds a ValueRecord, the path
// is parsed and resolved against that record's bytes via the shared
// recordResolver, and a Scalar/Count result is converted to a Value.
//
// Every other outcome — no '/' in field, no exact match and payloadKey holds
// something other than a ValueRecord, a path that fails to parse, or a
// Resolve that returns ErrPath/ErrRecord or a Table/RowPresent/Absent result
// (none of which is a scalar a filter can compare) — reports (Value{},
// false). This is deliberate even for a malformed path: the filter is
// compiled ONCE for the whole predicate tree, but the record named by
// payloadKey varies per point, so a path that is well-formed syntax but
// cannot apply to THIS point's record must degrade to "field absent" rather
// than fail the whole search. compileRowPresence is the one place a record
// path is inspected for something other than a scalar value (row presence).

// isRecordPath reports whether field has the "payloadKey/path" shape a
// record path filter uses: record.SplitField finds a '/' AND the tail
// parses as a record.Path. A field that does not have that shape (no '/',
// or a malformed tail) is a literal key and isRecordPath reports false for
// it — unchanged from today's behaviour.
//
// This is intentionally syntactic only: it does not (and cannot) know
// whether some point's metadata happens to carry field as an EXACT literal
// key (lookupPath's exact-key precedence would still honor that at
// evaluation time). Callers of isRecordPath — indexNarrowable and
// filterIndexExact — use it to decide whether the payload INDEX can prove
// anything about the field across every point, not to decide what one
// point's predicate evaluates to; declining a field the index cannot prove
// is always sound (the predicate re-checks it), so treating a
// path-shaped-but-possibly-literal field as "not narrowable" costs nothing
// but a slower fallback, never a wrong answer.
